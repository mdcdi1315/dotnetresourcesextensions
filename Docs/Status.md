## The status of the `DotNetResourcesExtensions` project 

This document describes the current status of the repository.

The repository has reached the version `1.0.5` as a __Stable__ release.

Now , the thought is to start moving to version `2.0.0`.

For this purpose , a new branch named `Version_2` has been created and
it is derived from `master`.

__NOTE__: The `master` branch does currently only apply for the version `>= 1.0.5` of the project
and thus any required changes (such as bugfixes) should be commited to this one.

The `Version_2` branch will continously be derived from `master` for any new version `>= 1.0.5` commits there.

The `Version_2` branch will be merged to `master` once the version `2.0.0` is considered stable.

When that will be done , the `Version_2` branch will not anymore accept any commits and will be considered as `archived`.
